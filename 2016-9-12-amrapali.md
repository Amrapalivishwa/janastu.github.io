Servelots has a good experiencial learnig environment.It is stressfree and self resposnsible place and i am happy to work here. 
In the year 2016, I was working on a SWTR project. SWTR is about overcoming the new accessibility challenges Using The Sweet Framework.  Not only the disabled and the technologically deprived, but also the able-bodied, who may still be facing linguistic, socio-cultural, cognitive type barriers. For example one is litterate but not know the language of content, than content could be renarrated in  to the local language,  one may be vision impaired or illitterat, for them original content could be audio recorded. content or the content is too techanichal and complex to understand, like layer's content could be simplified to the same or other language. 

Modiﬁcation of original static content to new taget content – a technique of Renarration – is modeled as a web-page transformation. This is operationally realized as "Sweets". Sweets are external meta data used for transformation of the web page. They are collaboratively and socially produced either by humans or human triggered Sweet based web applications. The entire web architecture featuring Sweets, their repositories and their web applications is a potential mechanism for overcoming New Accessibility barriers.

I worked on Alipi highlight that Sweets based architecture does indeed help in facing the barriers of New Accessibility. Overcoming a language barrier, a cultural barrier, a content-complexity barrier, or any of the New Accessibility barriers, is possible by re-telling, re-presenting or re-styling of the existing content to suit the new audience’s requirements. Individuals contributing to alternative narratives is the key aspect of re-narration Web. An individual can choose to provide alternative narration to any specific entity such as an image, a paragraph or subtitles for a segment of a video and such. The idea of the re-narration Web is to provide a person visiting a Web page, a comfortable narrative of the page content based on the visitor profile and contributions of alternative narratives made available by the community.

Regarding renarration I renarrated hampi site pages in Gujarati and Hindi for the pupose of testing of the alipi tool. To break the language and print impaired barrier I also did audio recording to the Gujarati and Hindi of many pages of hampi.in to the Gujarati and Hindi. I am a Gujarati, born and brought up in Ahmedabad and studied M.com in Gujarati medium. I also did diploma in yoga last year to take care of my health and to teach others. I love to trek. Once in a year we go for a lng trekking. This year we went to Tumkur for the anthill project meet-up. We did climbing devrayana durga where our family god is there and also trekked down to the farm house. 

Hampi is a backpacker's paradise, the same way a pilgrim's delight. I chose this because Hampi is a UNESCO World Heritage Site in India, located near Hospet town in the Karnataka state. Hampi is charismatic even in its ruined state, attracting thousands of visitors every year. Vast stretches of boulder-strewn hills make the backdrop of Hampi unique. Dotted around the hills and valleys are 500 plus monuments. Among them are beautiful temples, ruins of palaces, remains of aquatic structures, ancient market streets, royal pavilions, bastions, royal platforms, treasury buildings... the list is practically endless which tells untold story of India in 14 century, How rich, skilled and talented India was at that time. In Hampi at every turn there is a surprise. Every monument hides more than what they reveal. As an open museum, Hampi has numerous popular (100 plus!) locations visitors throng. 

I personally have visited Humpi in 2012, so when i was narrating pages from this site, I could connect and revisulising the spot mentally and could write my experience about the same.

Hampi website is about How to Reach Hampi? :  Hampi Maps that you can print and carry while exploring Hampi's attractions; Hampi's Mythology & History ; Hampi hotel locations, itinerary plan and much more on Hampi.

When i was renarrating alipi pages, problems faced are in the following link https://docs.google.com/a/servelots.com/document/d/1Gmr2SsuKMHzaL0sIfiFD8TNAsiegeXr5FoGjyz78jm4/edit?usp=sharing
 problem like edtor position or toolbar position or sometime after posting the content tool window will still displaying massage and not leading to the page where we could select the renarration to see etc came across.

I also renarrated many social websites regarding social problems like child marriage, dowry, Human trafficing, violence on women, social discremination according to caste - gender - status, girl education, child labour, child abuse, devdasi tradition. oppression, Minimum wages,  government's facilities or plans for the development of wemen or under previllaged, Water purification, Water born deseases to spred the awareness. Many times people are not aware of schemes which government provides or laws regarding social issues. Such available alternative renarratives which is comfortable to the community or an individual would provide knowledge, guidence and help in the similar situation. I also attemptted to narrate learn to talk English.

I also renarrated sites regarding environment awareness, noise pollution, water pollution, bio-chemicle pollution, bio divercity and many more subjects.......
SWTR - Semantic Web Technologies to share and integrate network of machine-readable data,  optionally, the semantics of that data. Semantic technology is popular for public sharing of data as well as for sharing and integration of data on private intranets. When project started initially i annotted 3000 images randomly like ornaments, beautiful places, flowers, new invention objects, dance postures, auras, useful objects, rare finominas, famous personalities, musical instruments, tourist spots, handicrafts, yoga and many more to do something constructive, I decided to do the project on 'Folk Dances of India'. India being vast country, has diverse religions, castes, languages, culture, festivals, rituals, music and food habits. It became very big project, then i devided it in to five part. Folk dances of Western India, Folk dances of South India, Folk dances of East India, Folk dances of North India, Folk dances of Central India.
 
I learnt from many websites, books and artists many things about religions, communities, seosons, Different types of celebrations of festivals, rituals at state border comman dialact languages and traditions. All are inter related. Relagious festivals are celebrated after harvesting which is related to seasons and local environment. In India First harvested crop is offered to the god or godesses first and then used for other purposes. Learnt about beliefs and how to use music and dance to bring recreation and kill boresome while working. There are relagious dances, harvest dances, traditional dances, classical dances, community dances, festival dances, cultural dances. Goan dances are influenced by Portugeese culture, In north Some part is influenced by Budhdhist culture. There are comman dances on the border of the Goa and Karnataka, Gujarat and Rajasthan, Punjab and Hariyana, seven sisters (North east India), Karnataka and Andhra pradesh. Gujarat and Maharashtra. Comanality between african and indian trible dance.

Festival of Diwali and Dasara are celebrated throughout India differently. Also came to know that because of urbanisation many musicle instruments, dances and oral folk songs and devotional songs and traditions are getting extinct. In kashmir from 350 instrument now only around 35 musucal instruments are existtng.
I learnt to do image and text annotations.  

Thanks to Bhanu who taught me how ontology and taging are used to pullout data in restory template to build and present about ones intrests. How the keywords are important and how one can present and connect different subjects. How big text annotations should be, what should be the image size and how to crop and resize and upload images,  how to see template on a local host, how to do text annotations and how should i narrate and present it like a story as my personal experience etc. 

He used restory template for an Autorikshow project, which i later used for folk dances of India. I pulled data from swtr store by using id for perticuler dance’s text annotations and image annotations.I wanted to add audio and video to the template to make it more connecting, but i could give only link. Problems i faced during swtr work are on the link https://docs.google.com/a/servelots.com/document/d/18eo1kEsRgYfxu4l8KNuQz58xR9pGfSXjgCmKggeovb0/edit?usp=sharing
sometimes i got the message - "The page you are looking for might have been removed, had its name changed, or is temporarily unavailable." then image will not appear.


Later to overcome these limitations we tried FOLD tool. In which i made folk dances of Gujarat web page.On this page one could highlight tags, attach videos, audios or images and rearrange the content. I found it very useful.
 
After that i made page on yoga, to help others to express the importance of yoga and how it is helpful in 21st century’s disorders like obesity, stress, diabetes, BP, knee pain, back pain, breathing problems and many more....

In february 2016, I started working on chaha.in project which is about representing intangible Hampi.
How the Girija kalyanotsava, Dasara and other festivals are celebrated now and earlier in seventeenth century at Hampi and Mysore, Hampi rathotsava, Hampi festival, Hampi jatre, River rituals, Community rituals, Tribles, Art and Craft, Village dasara,Mahanavmi puja, Mysore dasara, folk songs, oral narratives, harritage villages and deitys are being presented to preserve our traditional way of leaving and make it to reach all.  

Again thanks to bhanu who helped me to learn wordpress to present this work. He enabled me to use gimp editor to resize images, how to write an article, how the content should flow, where to keep which images, how to upload images and how image slider works. I choose many images from pantoto server related to Girija kalyana, dasara and river rituals, phal puja, community rituals, brahmbh rathotsava, village dasara, Mysore dasara, Harritage village and deities and prepared post for the same using wordpress. I prepared content from the pdf for all the posts. I saw all the images and selected and downloaded many images from that almost resized 500 images to 350 kb, below 1000 px and uploaded to the server which were related. One day Image slider stopped working so i again choose images from the server and reformatted content and images to redid all the posts. sometimes some images would become very dim or get cut from top important part. I also did some documantation for the hampi data like videos and images who is speaking at that time and about what and put some tags. In Images i put tags and subjects. I learnt many things. I also interacted with caluvraju regarding data and followed him for the same. 

I googled and also read from the book shared by Bhanu, and I prepared a google doc regarding old dasara in villages and Mtsore and present days dasara in villages and mysore content and images. 
I also presented Mysore and village dasara data in Omeka to work around Omeka for future NCBS work. again thanks to bhanu who taught me hoe to feed data in omeka. i downloaded and uploded images and gave description, time, publisher's name. grouped related images. 

I gave SWTR and Alipi demo to interns.

Then i worked on testing of pondymap where found some bugs like loging in and registering the user name were problems if someone presses 'enter' key, and also shared in writing in FaQ for the Pondymap. I took 200 images of different subject and uploaded to the server which helped to find out the bug regarding location. Longitude and lattitude are not showing properly. I also wrote about Pondycherry History. I googled images for the same. How Pondtcherry had gone through different phases and how it was urbanised.  

I also prepared Janastu blog report, Who is working on which project on which day, which lead to develop form where everyone reports everyday and the same information can be pulled without rewriting everyones work.

In August we visited Devraya durga for the Anthill meet up where diffrent people belonging to diffent work area and intrest meet up and share there work experience and future projects, so i wrote a google doc for my experience and shared it to others to give their feedback on the event.
